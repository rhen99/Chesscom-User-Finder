# Chesscom User Finder

### Description

This is a simple app that searches users using the [Chess.com API](https://www.chess.com/news/view/published-data-api). The UI is made with Chakra UI. It's the first time I've used it and it's pretty powerful.

### What I've Learned

- Chakra UI
- Chess.com API

### Possible Improvments

- Add more functionality
- Use more of the API
